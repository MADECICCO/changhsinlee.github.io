This post follows my previous post [How I Learned Data Science Skills as a Math PhD](https://changhsinlee.github.io/learning-skills-for-data-science/), where I left off at saying meetups are awesome. Here, I am going to share my experience on a particular meetup, the Developer Launchpad Nashville, and the role it played in when I was changing career.

### The Need for Company

When I returned to Nashville from my summer internship, I had mixed feelings about my future. I became confident that I could make the move to industry, but I also knew that I was far from ready for data science. How could I bridge this gap? I started searching for tips on becoming a better programmer. After a while, I came across a Quora question that had several generic answers. But one answer had a bullet point that I had not seen before --- go to meetups.

Meetup was a new concept to me. When I tried to picture what it would look like, all I could think of was the intro sequence of Fight Club, where the narrator hopped from one support group to another. I knew that professionals went to conferences for growth and networking, but what is a meetup? Who goes to a meetup? What does it have to do with becoming a better programmer? I was intrigued.

*His name was Robert Paulson...*

So I googled meetup and ended up on [meetup.com](meetup.com). It sounded like dating site. But when I got on it and set my location to Nashville, a full page of tech meetups popped up: machine learning, data science, Python, Javascript, virtual reality, and more. Having little idea what a meetup was or what I wanted, I RSVP'd for a few that were meeting in the following week.

The first meetup that I went to was the machine learning group. Going to a strange place to meet strangers was scary. I had a hard time getting out of my door and driving to the venue that evening. When I arrived, however, there was food from Pei Wei, and other first-timers in the line. After talking with some of them, I felt the whole thing wasn't as awkward as I expected it to be. Following the meal was a talk, whose content was way above my head. But I knew that if I keep coming back, one day I will understand what it was about. I decided to find more meetups and see what's out there.

### The Developer Launchpad
Some meetups in Nashville that I looked into were aimed at junior developers. The only programming skills I had were MATLAB and R, both at a junior level. I thought I could benefit from going to junior developer meetups. Among them, Developer Launchpad (called CodeNewbie Nashville then) was the closest one in distance to me, so I RSVP'd for the Saturday coding jam at a coffee shop in my neighborhood.

I showed up late that day. There were already a dozen people in the room. In the middle of them were two bearded dudes that didn't look like developers. At least they didn't fit into any of the developer stereotypes I knew in Taiwan. Soon I realized those two were the hosts for the meetup.

One of the two bearded dudes started speaking about the agenda for the day and what to expect in the next few weeks --- we were going to build a website together. They had set up a Github repository for the project, and as our first steps we would:

* download (clone) the repository.
* add our name to the readme file.
* upload (push) the readme file back to Github.

It was a short list, but it triggered my fear --- Github was one of the tools that I had avoided since I picked up programming. I had tried reading Git and Github documentations for several times, but I still couldn't grasp what Git was for or how to use it. I thought it was a tool for legit developers, not for a beginner who was groping around like me.

But since I've committed my time to come here, I wasn't going to sit there and do nothing. I went to another guy in the room and asked for help. I told him that I didn't understand the instructions at all and needed help. He said he understood my pain as he went through similar trouble when he started at a coding bootcamp. He proceeded to show me everything --- installing and configuring Git, cloning the repository, editing the markdown, and pushing it back to Github. In 30 minutes I made my first push to Github. That day I went home happy with a sense of achievement. Within 30 minutes of meetup, I got rid of the fear of Github that I held for 6 months.

Before I moved to Charlotte in June 2017, I went to Developer Launchpad meetups every month. We worked on the coding challenges together and had many great conversations. Looking back, I didn't know how much I had to do to kick start a new career. Reinventing myself was stressful. At Developer Launchpad, I met junior developers who went through or were going through similar processes, and I got to hear their stories and learn. Knowing that there were people fighting the same mental battle --- and that people won those battles --- kept me going despite all the failures, doubts, and frustrations that came from my job search. It was awesome.

### Next

In the next post, I will continue on my meetup experience and talk about another community --- [the Penny Universty](http://www.pennyuniversity.org) --- that I found by going to meetups. I am going to explain what I learned from it, and how it helped me get a data science job.

*P.S. The two bearded dudes from Developer Launchpad ([@Bowtiebeej](https://twitter.com/BowtieBeej) and [@GantSoftSys](https://twitter.com/GantSoftSys)) are also hosts for the [Complete Developer Podcast](http://completedeveloperpodcast.com/). Itâ€™s good stuff and I enjoyed the soft skills episodes.*
