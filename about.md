Born and raised in Taiwan, I have landed on Albuquerque, Nashville, Tampa, and Charlotte. I'm a data scientist by trade, and a baseball fan by heart. This blog is for my long thoughts. The short ones are on [@ChangLeeTW](https://twitter.com/ChangLeeTW).

This blog is built on [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) by Barry Clark.
